## Summary
This github repo contains monthly expense 2021 dataset files along with powerbi notebook report and HTML file for the website. The dataset contains monthly expenses in regard with budget for various categories and items.

## Details
I have firstly created Azure Blob storage resource. I have created 2 datasets there. Then I have used PowerBI for my project, and from the menu bar I have chosen "Get Data" and linked it with my azure portal's blob storage. I imported my dataset from the blob storage and did my analysis. I have made several comparisons on budget ans expenses of 2021 year.
